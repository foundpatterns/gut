# gut

* `gut start` -- initialize repo
* `gut save` -- save current repo files
* `gut diff` -- changes since last repo save
* `gut patches` -- show patches directory
* `gut series` -- show current chain of patches
* `gut forward|backward` -- navigate the chain of patches
* .gutomit - leave out files from patches

this is a rough draft.  there's still a lot to do, within Torchbear and Rust libraries as well.
